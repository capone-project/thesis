- how to guarantee host security?

- computing nodes?
    - applications cannot interfere with each other
    - many-to-many relation between nodes/slaves
    - capabilities request features
    - secure windowing system required
        - input focus important
    - IPC?
        - requires notion of who is accepted to interact with
          oneself

- encryption between slave nodes
    - host is ONLY there for matchmaking
    - host CANNOT possibly know about contents between nodes

- graphics
    - graphics representation on host system
    - input system on host system
    - slave only display host
    - HDCP

- benefits:
    - hardware cannot ever possibly communicate over internet
